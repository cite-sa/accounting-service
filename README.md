# Accounting Service

The Accounting service provides an aggregation functionality through which various services can centrally log accounting information as it is gradually accumulated by their usage from the respective authorized clients. Different accumulation policies and granularity of information is supported depending on the respective services. The information consists of globally defined key point indicators and the aggregation and reports generated based on these becomes available for further usage, as appropriate.
